object AdjustTrackerYaw {

	/**
	 * Adjusts the yaw of a tracker.
	 *
	 * We apply 3 forces to the tracker which help keep it balanced with the
	 * rest of the trackers in the skeleton. Hopefully, this leads to a
	 * reasonable alignment which closely matches the player's real alignment.
	 *
	 * Locked Trackers
	 * ---------------
	 * When a tracker is at rest, we lock it and save its yaw. We assume that
	 * locked trackers really are at rest, and that any rotation is due to yaw
	 * drift. We add an error term that is the difference between the tracker's
	 * yaw and its locked yaw. This works very well when the player is leaning
	 * against something, e.g. a chair or couch. But when the player is
	 * standing still, they tend to sway back toward the neutral position, which
	 * causes us to adjust the tracker a bit too much outwards. Luckily, this is
	 * balanced by the centering force.
	 *
	 * Centering Force
	 * ---------------
	 * We have a centering force which nudges the trackers into a relaxed pose
	 * for the player. For example, we know that a standing player tends to be
	 * facing forward with their legs slightly spread apart. We calculate the
	 * average yaw of the skeleton and nudge the trackers into the expected
	 * position centered around this average yaw.
	 *
	 * Neighbor Trackers
	 * -----------------
	 * The player is often not in a relaxed pose. If we only had the above
	 * forces, a moving tracker next to a locked tracker can rotate into
	 * unnatural positions. For example, consider a lower leg tracker that is
	 * moving, next to a foot tracker that is locked, but stretched out
	 * in-front of the player. The centering force will try to adjust the
	 * lower leg tracker back to the relaxed position, which could be very far
	 * away from the foot tracker. To address this, we nudge the tracker into
	 * the midpoint between its neighbors, after accounting for the relaxed
	 * pose.
	 *
	 * After we calculate all these error terms, we weight them, and use
	 * gradient descent to find the direction to apply a yaw correction. By
	 * applying this 50 times a second, the whole body is nudged into a
	 * reasonable alignment.
